"Header Enhancement is a simple yet extremely handy WordPress plugin to "
"enhance your custom header video. The plugin is for those who’re trying "
"to showcase the best in their header section with their communicative "
"videos. It is completely free of cost and comes with powerful features. "
"With the plugin installed and activated, you can easily add the video you "
"want in your header and that too with sound effects. Also, not to forget, "
"your header video will be displayed elegantly on mobile devices as well. "
"A header video with sound and full support for small screen sizes, what "
"more could you ask for? Set a header image, just for a backup if "
"something goes wrong with your header video at times. Flaunt the best in "
"you through your expressive header video and make your website of any "
"kind engaging. The features you would get in Header Enhancement are Sound "
"Support and Mobile Friendliness - features your header video needs to "
"catch the visitors’ eyes. You can either upload your local video or paste "
"the YouTube URL of the video. Either way, your header video will be "
"displayed elegantly across all screen sizes, even on the mobile devices."
