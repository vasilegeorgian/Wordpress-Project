We document consent completely and make it possible to trace the origin of the consent afterwards. You are on the safe side even in the worst case!

**Native in WordPress:** Real Cookie Banner is a cookie plugin specially designed for WordPress. It is fully installed in your WordPress as a native plugin. All consents are processed and stored on your server. Nothing is downloaded from a cloud in your visitor's browser, which avoids further legal issues.

=== Full-featured cookie plugin and consent management for WordPress ===

Real Cookie Banner is a WordPress cookie plugin that enables you to obtain consent to load services and set cookies in accordance with the GDPR and ePrivacy Directive (EU Cookie Law). In addition, we ensure for you that styles, scripts, iframes, etc. are only loaded when users give their consent with so-called Content Blockers. A service scanner helps you to configure the cookie banner with ease. To be on the safe side, you should document all consents of your website to prove them in case of doubt. An automatic documentation of consents is also included in this plugin.

**(Why) do I need an opt-in cookie banner?**

Nearly all websites that target users from the EU require a cookie banner that obtains explicit consent (opt-in procedure) and documents the consent. It is practically impossible to operate a website without cookies and external services requiring consent, as otherwise you would have to go without many features and services such as Google Analytics, Google Fonts, YouTube videos, personal recommendations, etc.

Legally, the obligation is based on the ePrivacy Directive ([Directive 2009/136/EC](https://devowl.io/go/eu-directive-2009-136-ec)) Art. 66, which describes that setting of cookies that are not strictly technically necessary requires the explicit consent of the user. The ePrivacy Directive has not yet been transposed into national law by many EU countries, but it must be applied nevertheless. The CURIA clarified on October 1, 2019 in [case C-673/17](https://devowl.io/go/curia-c-673-17) that e.g. the German special way of an opt-out procedure is not in accordance with the ePrivacy Directive. Since then, it must be assumed that only the opt-in procedure is permissible. This was also confirmed by the Federal Court of Justice for Germany on May 28, 2020 ([Case I ZR 7/16](https://devowl.io/de/go/bgh-i-zr-7-16) - Cookie Consent II).

Contrary to the assumption of many, the GDPR plays only a minor role with regard to cookies. Although it defines how personal data must be processed, it explicitly leaves the question of how to deal with cookies to the ePrivacy Directive.

However, you also need consents for the processing of personal data according to [Art. 6 GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/). also dynamic IP addresses of your website visitors can be personal data, according to the [ECJ](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf;?text=&amp;docid=184668&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=EN&amp;mode=lst&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=3164186). Therefore, even the embedding of a YouTube video, for example, may require consent, even if no cookies would be set. In addition, there are many other requirements on how a consent according to the GDPR has to look like. For example, according to [Art. 8 GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-8-gdpr/), you as a website operator must ensure appropriate protection of minors in the consent in your cookie banner.

**What if I don't have an opt-in cookie banner?**

More than [10,000 websites have already been asked to set up their cookie banners correctly](https://noyb.eu/en/noyb-aims-end-cookie-banner-terror-and-issues-more-500-gdpr-complaints) by the data protection organization noyb. Website operators who did not respond were reported to the local data protection authorities. The consumer advice centers in Germany have [sent official warnings to around 1,000 website operators](https://www.heise.de/news/Verbraucherschuetzer-mahnen-Firmen-wegen-Cookie-Bannern-ab-6194491.html). [Google has already been fined EUR 120 million](https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/france-fines-google-120m-and-amazon-42m-for-dropping-tracking-cookies-without-consent/) and Amazon EUR 42 million for incorrect cookie banners. And these are just a few selected actions that were taken against website operators who had no or insufficient cookie banner.

There is danger from several sides. Public authorities can impose fines under the GDPR of up to EUR 20 million or, in the case of a company, up to 4% of its total global annual turnover in the previous financial year, whichever is higher. In addition, national law such as the TTDSG in Germany can result in further and often more easily enforceable fines. In addition, warning letters from consumer protection organizations, legitimate data protection organizations and also competitors are possible after individual case assessment.

If you have an insufficient cookie banner, or you don't have a cookie banner yet, although you need one, it is strongly advised to act now!

**Why another cookie plugin for cookie consents?**

There are already widely used cookie banner solutions like Borlabs Cookie, Complianz, Cookiebot, GDPR Cookie Consent or Cookie Notice for GDPR &amp; CCPA. In our point of view, many of these cookie plugins only partially implement the legal requirements or advised behavior, which bears a risk for website operators. Without a serious look at the law, you won't know about it until you get a warning in your mailbox. In addition, most solutions are not so flexible and customizable that we would recommend using them on a professional website.

We have implemented a cookie consent banner that in our opinion meets the legal requirements, is very flexible and customizable, can be set up legally correct in only about an hour and solves many other problems. Through a market research and survey with WordPress users before we started the development of the cookie consent tool, we have identified many issues. We have tested the implemented cookie plugins intensively in user tests in practice so that we can offer you a comprehensive and intuitive solution.
