According to the Cookie Directive 2002/58/EC, the economic interest of authors to participate in the payouts of VG WORT does not entitle them to set the cookie without the user's consent (essential cookie). Further information on this legal opinion can be found on the Website of %1$sIT-Recht Kanzlei (German)%2$s.<br /><br />This is countered by the claim arising from %3$sÂ§ 53 UrhG (German law)%4$s in Germany for compensation for the use of works protected by copyright. Without a counter for all users of a website, this entitlement cannot be enforced or can only be enforced incompletely, since without a counter it is not possible to determine how many users visit a text and thus the copying probability for the use of copyrighted works cannot be determined. Therefore, VG WORT should be classified as an essential cookie.<br /><br />In order to act legally, we recommend classifying the cookie as a âStatistics\" cookie and blocking it by using a content blocker for users without consent. Pragmatically, however, this will significantly reduce or completely prevent your income from VG WORT payouts.

For this purpose, a UUID (pseudonymous identification of the user) is assigned to each website visitor, which is valid until the cookie expires to store the consent. Cookies are used to test whether cookies can be set, to store reference to documented consent, to store which services from which service groups the visitor has consented to, and, if consent is obtained under the Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF), to store consent in TCF partners, purposes, special purposes, features and special features. As part of the obligation to disclose according to GDPR, the collected consent is fully documented. This includes, in addition to the services and service groups to which the visitor has consented, and if consent is obtained according to the TCF standard, to which TCF partners, purposes and features the visitor has consented, all cookie banner settings at the time of consent as well as the technical circumstances (e.g. size of the displayed area at the time of consent) and the user interactions (e.g. clicking on buttons) that led to consent.
